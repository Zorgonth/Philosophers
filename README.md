The Dining Philosophers problem is a thought experiment that involves a group of philosophers sitting around a circular dining table. Each philosopher spends their life eating, sleeping and thinking. To eat, a philosopher needs two forks, one on their left and one on their right. The challenge is to design a solution to allow philosophers to eat without causing deadlocks, contention, or resource allocation conflicts.
